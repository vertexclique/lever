//! Lever is a library for writing transactional systems (esp. for in-memory data). It consists of various parts:
//!
//! * `index`: Indexes and lookup structures
//! * `stats`: Statistics structures
//! * `sync`: Synchronization primitives for transactional systems
//! * `table`: Various KV table kinds backed by transactional algorithms
//! * `txn`: Transactional primitives and management
//!
//! Lever is using MVCC model to manage concurrency. It supplies building blocks for in-memory data stores for
//! transactional endpoints, databases and systems. Unblocked execution path is main aim for lever while
//! not sacrificing failover mechanisms.
//!
//! Lever provides STM, lock-free, wait-free synchronization primitives and various other tools to facilitate writing
//! transactional in-memory systems.
